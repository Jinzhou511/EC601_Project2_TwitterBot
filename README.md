# EC601HW2TwitterAPI
1. This is a TwitterBot, it can automatically find the tweet which @ it and with specif content: "#zjz", then reply it with: zjz.
2. But TWITTER always shut it down or restrict it, I have no idea.
3. You need to input your own API key, API key secret, ACCESS key, ACCESS key secret.
4. I learnt it from Youtube Uploader: Certified Recaps.
5. There are still some small function mistakes, I might fixed it later.
